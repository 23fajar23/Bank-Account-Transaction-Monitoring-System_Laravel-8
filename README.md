✨ ~ Bank Account Transaction Monitoring System ~ ✨
-
✨👋 Hi Everyone 👋✨


Now I want to share a project that I have worked on with you, this project is a system that monitors your account transactions, so you can monitor your expenses and income. In this project you have 2 authorities namely admin and user. This project uses Laravel 8 as its base so it is easy to learn. Most of the languages ​​I use are PHP and JavaScript.

There are various types of REST APIs that I created so that clients who integrate with this system can access their data easily. You can try the system yourself in this project and I have also provided a database for demo data so you can use it easily. You can also take and observe the CRUD that I have created so you can learn from it.

Steps after you clone this project :
-

- Create an empty database with mutation name and import the database in /Database folder to your RDBMS.
- Then copy file .env.example and rename to .env
- open terminal and go to directory "Project"
- then run command "composer install"
- run command "php artisan key:generate"
- and then run command "php artisan migrate:refresh --seed"
- final step you can run command "php artisan serve" for run this project.


Note :
-
You can log in as admin by using the email address "admin@gmail.com" and password "12345678" then to log in as an initial user, I have provided a demo account with email "user@gmail.com" and password "12345678"

Good luck ✌✨
